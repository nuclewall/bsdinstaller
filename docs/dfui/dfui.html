<h1>DragonFly Abstract User Interface (DFUI)</h1>

<p><i>$Id: dfui.html,v 1.2 2004/07/17 01:50:34 cpressey Exp $</i></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes a user interface (UI) abstraction which allows an
application to communicate with a user through any number of kinds
of concrete user interfaces, such as <code>curses</code>, GTK+, or a
web browser.</p>

<p>This abstraction should be suitable for presenting the DragonFly system
installer to the user; however it need not and should not be limited to only the
installer.  Many other tasks in DragonFly, such as system configuration and
package installation, could and for the sake of consistency should use the
same UI.</p>

<h2>Abstraction</h2>

<p>The DFUI abstraction isolates the semantics of user interation from
the concrete details of it, similar to a <i>Model View Controller</i>
abstraction.  Such a system is split into <i>frontend</i> and <i>backend</i>:

<ul>
<li>The backend contains the control logic and invokes the tool programs (such
as <code>fdisk</code>.)</li>
<li>The frontend constructs the concrete user interface (with widgets and such)
and presents it to the user.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The backend tells the frontend what kind of conversation to hold with the user;
the frontend tells the backend the user's ultimate decisions.</p>

<p>The backend talks to the frontend in terms of abstract user interface elements.
It tells the frontend nothing about <em>how</em> the UI should
be presented, only the bare essentials of what it must convey.  Likewise, the frontend
talks to the backend in terms of data.  It keeps trivia about the user (like what language
they are using) to itself.  In this way, we maintain component isolation: the
backend is concerned only with the <i>semantics</i> of the user interaction, while
the frontend is concerned only with its <i>implementation</i>.</p>

<p>The frontend may be constructed in almost any manner.  It may be a
<code>curses</code> program, or it may be a CGI.  This presents a unique barrier, namely that the
frontend might be either a single, long-running process <em>or</em> a series of short-running
processes.  This essentially requires a concurrently design where the frontend and backend
exist in seperate processes that exchange messages using IPC.</p>

<p>The contrast between the <code>curses</code> scenario and the CGI scenario
is illustrated below.</p>

</td><td align="right" valign="top">
<p><img src="session_cgi.png"></p>
</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>This abstraction gives us several benefits:

<ul>
<li>We're not tying the installer (and other tasks) to one specific user interface toolkit.
<li>We're not even tying the installer (and other tasks) to one particular <i>kind</i> of UI.
<li>The code for the installation process itself should be easier to manage
because it won't be clouded with UI details.
<li>The code for the UI itself should be easier to manage
because it won't be clouded with installer details.
<li>The frontend and backend don't have to be written in the same
programming language (with some caveats; see below.)
<li>We have the opportunity for the frontend and backend to work
asymchronously (with some caveats; see below.)
<li>We can use the same UI consistently for all tasks, rather than only in the installer.
</ul></p>

<h2>Data Types</h2>

<p>Each of the messages sent between the frontend and the backend consists of
one piece of data.  Before getting to the messages themselves, we'll examine the
data types in use.</p>

<h3>Id's</h3>

<p>Many of the other data types each have an <i>id</i>.</p>

<p>An id is a key which identifies the object to both the frontend and the
backend.  It should be unique across all similar objects in the same container.
(i.e. a form id should be unique across all forms in a session, a field id should
be unique across all fields in a form, etc.)</p>

<p>Id's are implemented as a short alphanumeric (plus underscores) strings
such as <code>disk_select_menu</code>.</p>

<h3>Info Blocks</h3>

<p>Many of the other data types each have an <i>info block</i>.</p>

<p>In contrast to the id, which the computer uses to tell objects apart, an
info block is for the human operator's benefit.  Each info block contains:

<ul>
<li>the <i>name</i> of the object, which should be a short and
descriptive title such as "Select Disk";</li>
<li>the <i>short description</i> of the object, which should be one or
two sentences describing the purpose of the object; and</li>
<li>the <i>long description</i> of the object, which is analogous to
a "help file" on the object which should describe its purpose and
behaviour in a usefully verbose way.  The long description component
of an info block need not contain the actual text of the long description;
it should instead contain a reference to it in the form of a filename or URL.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Forms</h3>

<p>The basic unit of interaction is a <i>form</i>.  While typically displayed as
a familiar electronic version of a paper fill-out form, it is defined abstractly enough
to not pose any obstacles should we need to deal with other media.  However,
in this document we will give typical examples using a familiar GUI interpretation.</p>

<p>Each form consists of:

<ul>
<li>a form id</li>
<li>an info block</li>
<li>a <i>multiplicity flag</i></li>
<li>zero or more <i>fields</i></li>
<li>one or more <i>actions</i></li>
<li>zero or more <i>properties</i></li>
<li>zero or more <i>datasets</i></li>
</ul></p>

<p>The multiplicity flag determines whether there is a single set of data displayed on the
form (multiplicity = false), or multiple sets of data (multiplicity = true).
The former resembles a 'dialog box' in a typical UI.
The latter resembles a spreadsheet or database entry form, with zero or more 'rows'
of a data, and facilities for the user to add, remove, etc rows.  Examples of these
two different layout styles are shown below (note of course that these are only
examples - the frontend may interpret them any reasonable way it likes.)</p>

<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding=4 border=1>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
<p align="center">multiplicity = false</p>
<p><img src="form_single.png"></p>
</td><td align="right" valign="top">
<p align="center">multiplicity = true</p>
<p><img src="form_multiple.png"></p>
</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<h3>Fields</h3>

<p>Each field describes a piece of data that the user can view and possibly manipulate.
In a typical GUI, fields are rendered as text boxes and similar widgets.
Each field has:

<ul>
<li>a field id</li>
<li>an info block</li>
<li>zero or more <i>options</i></li>
<li>zero or more <i>properties</i></li>
</ul></p>

<p>A form with zero fields has only actions, and might typically look like a menu
or informative-only dialog box.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>Each action describes an action that can be taken.
In a typical GUI, actions are rendered as buttons that can be clicked.
Each action consists of:

<ul>
<li>an action id</li>
<li>an info block</li>
<li>zero or more <i>properties</i></li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Datasets</h3>

<p>Each dataset describes a set of data that is displayed or entered into a
form.  In a form with more than zero fields, a multiplicity = false form has
exactly one dataset, while a multiplicity = true form may have more than one.
A form with zero fields must have zero datasets.</p>

<p>Each dataset consists of a set of one celldata for each field of the form.</p>

<h3>Celldatas</h3>

<p>A celldata represents a value entered into a field on a form, either
as a default value by the backend, or by the user's choice.</p>

<p>Each celldata consists of:

<ul>
<li>the field id to which it applies</li>
<li>the value</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The data type of all celldata values, as far as DFUI is concerned, is text.
The backend may convert the text into a more semantically meaningful format,
such as floating-point values, internally.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<p>Each field has zero or more options.  These are supplied values that the
user may choose to place in the field.</p>

<p>The semantics of options in combination with the editable flag are summarized here:

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Editable flag</th><th>Number of Options</th><th>Semantics</th></tr>
<tr><td>true</td><td>zero</td><td>user may manually enter any value in field</td></tr>
<tr><td>true</td><td>one or more</td><td>user may manually enter any value in field, or may select any option to fill field with ("combo box")</td></tr>
<tr><td>false</td><td>zero</td><td>user may not enter data into field in any fashion</td></tr>
<tr><td>false</td><td>one or more</td><td>user may not manually enter values into field, but may select an option to fill the field with ("list box")</td></tr>
</table></p>

<h3>Responses</h3>

<p>Each response describes a user's decision.  Each response consists of:

<ul>
<li>a form id</li>
<li>an action id</li>
<li>zero or more datasets</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The form id indicates the form that this is a response to.</p>

<p>The action id indicates the action that the user executed which caused
this response.</p>

<p>The datasets contain the user's choices.  When the form is
multiplicity = false, there should be exactly one dataset; when the form
is multiplicity = true, there should be one dataset per "row" of data that the
user entered.  Either way, there should always be one celldata per field
of the form in each dataset.</p>

<h3>Progresses</h3>

<p>A progress represents some task which takes a relatively long time to
complete; in a typical GUI it would be implemented by a progress bar.
Each progress consists of:

<ul>
<li>an info block</li>
<li>an <i>amount</i></li>
</ul></p>

<p>The amount is an integer which ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates
no progress has been made, and 100 indicates that the task is finished.</p>

<p>Progresses do not have responses, but they may be cancelled.</p>

<h3>Properties</h3>

<p>See <code><a href="property.html">dfui_property</a></code>.</p>

<h2>Messages</h2>

<p>The backend may send the following kinds of messages to the frontend:

<ul>
<li><code>present(<i>form</i>)</code></li>
<li><code>prog_begin(<i>progress</i>)</code></li>
<li><code>prog_update(<i>progress</i>)</code></li>
<li><code>prog_end()</code></li>
<li><code>stop()</code></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The frontend may send the following kinds of replies to the backend:

<ul>
<li><code>submit(<i>response</i>)</code></li>
<li><code>continue()</code></li>
<li><code>cancel()</code></li>
<li><code>abort()</code></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>These may, in theory, be asynchronous: the backend may, for example, send several
<code>present</code> messages before receiving any <code>submit</code> replies,
so long as there is some way to identify which <code>submit</code>s are associated with
which <code>present</code>s (i.e. the form id).</p>

<p>However, in practice, while some UI's support concurrently displaying multiple
UI elements in a natural fashion (typified by "windows",) others do not.  So to begin,
we will limit ourselves by enforcing
a sychronous discipline: each message from the backend must be replied by a reply from
the frontend before the next message from the backend is sent.</p>

<h3>The <code>present</code> Message</h3>

<p>The <code>present</code> message carries a form as a payload.  Upon
receipt of this message, the frontend should display the form and let the user
manipulate it.</p>

<p>The frontend may then reply to a <code>present</code> message with:

<ul>
<li>a <code>submit</code> reply with the corresponding form id, which
indicates that the user chose an action from the form; or</li>
<li>an <code>abort</code> reply, which indicates something catastrophic happened
and that the backend should halt everything.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The <code>submit</code> Reply</h3>

<p>The <code>submit</code> reply carries a response as a payload.  It should
only occur after a <code>present</code> message.</p>

<h3>The <code>prog_begin</code> Message</h3>

<p>A <code>prog_begin</code> message carries a progress as a payload
and indicates that a progress has begun.</p>

<p>The frontend may reply to a <code>prog_begin</code> message with:

<ul>
<li>a <code>continue</code> reply, indicating all is well; or</li>
<li>an <code>abort</code> reply, indicating the backend should halt.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The <code>prog_update</code> Message</h3>

<p>A <code>prog_update</code> message carries a progress as a payload
and indicates that the state of progress has changed.</p>

<p>The frontend may reply to a <code>prog_update</code> message with:

<ul>
<li>a <code>continue</code> reply, indicating all is well;</li>
<li>a <code>cancel</code> reply, indicating that the user cancelled the
progress; or</li>
<li>an <code>abort</code> reply, indicating the backend should halt.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The <code>prog_end</code> Message</h3>

<p>A <code>prog_end</code> message indicates that a progress is finished.
It has no payload.</p>

<p>The frontend may reply to a <code>prog_end</code> message with:

<ul>
<li>a <code>continue</code> reply, indicating all is well; or</li>
<li>an <code>abort</code> reply, indicating the backend should halt.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The <code>stop</code> Message</h3>

<p>The <code>stop</code> message has no payload; it simply tells the frontend
that the backend has finished processing.  The frontend may exit, if it is a
long-running process, or it may simply display a 'finished' page, if it is a
short-running CGI process.</p>

<h2>Library</h2>

<p>Let us consider now a library, <code>libdfui</code>, which implements this abstraction:

<ul>
<li>A C program could use functions in this library directly.
<li>A program in another high-level language, such as Python,
could use the functions in this library with a C binding made
(with, say, SWIG) for this purpose.
<li>A shell script could use these functions via
utility programs which parse their arguments and call
these functions directly (or via a proxy daemon.)
</ul></p>

<h3>Backend</h3>

<p>From the backend's point of view, the useful functions in this library are
as follows.  Each function returns an error response (1 = success, 0 = failure.)</p>

<ul>
<li><code>dfui_be_start(struct dfui_connection *c)</code>
<p>Connect to the frontend and return a handle to it in <code>c</code>.  XXX this function
also needs to know what frontend to try to connect to and how somehow.</p>
<li><code>dfui_be_present(struct dfui_connection *c, struct dfui_form *f, struct dfui_response *r)</code>
<p>Ask the frontend on the other end of <code>c</code> to present the form <code>f</code>, wait
for a submit reply, and return the response in <code>r</code></p>
<li><code>dfui_be_prog_begin(struct dfui_connection *c, struct dfui_progress *p)</code>
<p>Ask the frontend on the other end of <code>c</code> to start showing the progress <code>p</code>.</p>
<li><code>dfui_be_prog_update(struct dfui_connection *c, struct dfui_progress *p)</code>
<p>Ask the frontend on the other end of <code>c</code> to update the progress <code>p</code>.</p>
<li><code>dfui_be_prog_end(struct dfui_connection *c)</code>
<p>Ask the frontend on the other end of <code>c</code> to stop showing any progress.</p>
<li><code>dfui_be_stop(struct dfui_connection *c)</code>
<p>Tell the frontend on the other end of <code>c</code> to stop, and close the connection.</p>
</ul>

<p>Notably, there are also functions for constructing <code>struct dfui_form</code>s and its
brethren, and for intrerpreting and freeing <code>struct dfui_response</code>s.</p>

<h3>Frontend</h3>

<p>From the frontend's point of view, the useful functions in this library are
as follows. Like the backend, these all return failure/success values.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>dfui_fe_start(struct dfui_connection *c)</code>
<p>Connect to the backend XXX somehow.</p>
<li><code>dfui_fe_receive(struct dfui_connection *c, char *msgtype, void **payload)</code>
<p>Wait for the backend to send a message, then return the message type in <code>*msgtype</code>
and the message itself in <code>*payload</code>.  It is the frontend's reponsibility to cast the
payload to the correct data type (based on <code>*msgtype</code>,) and to free it at some later
time if it is not NULL.</p>
<li><code>dfui_fe_submit(struct dfui_connection *c, struct dfui_response *r)</code>
<p>Send a submit reply to the backend.</p>
<li><code>dfui_fe_progress_continue(struct dfui_connection *c)</code>
<p>Send a continue reply to the backend.</p>
<li><code>dfui_fe_progress_cancel(struct dfui_connection *c)</code>
<p>Send a cancel reply to the backend.</p>
<li><code>dfui_fe_abort(struct dfui_connection *c)</code>
<p>Send an abort reply to the backend.</p>
<li><code>dfui_fe_stop(struct dfui_connection *c)</code>
<p>Close the connection.</p>
</ul>

<p>Notably, there are also functions for intrerpreting <code>struct dfui_form</code>s et al,
and for constructing and freeing <code>struct dfui_responses</code>s.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The IPC used by libdfui, through which the frontend and backend exchange messages
and replies, is a wrapper around the CAPS mechanism.  CAPS is the lightweight messaging
abstraction Matt Dillon has introduced into DragonFly.</p>

<p>CAPS was chosen for two reasons: it fulfils DFUI's needs as an IPC mechanism, and DFUI
provides a good "real world" test for CAPS.</p>

<p>The implementation of libdfui in CAPS is fairly straightforward, with one significant twist.</p>

<p>Despite the backend sending 'requests' and the frontend sending 'replies', the backend is
a CAPS service, while the frontend is a CAPS client.  This is necessary as the frontend could
be a series of short-lived processes.  A CAPS service cannot receive a message in one
process and reply to it in another.</p>

<p>We implement this role reversal by having each message exchange, as described above,
be implemented by two full CAPS message-reply exchange cycles internally.</p>

<p>That is, for a backend to send a message to the frontend, the backend waits until it
receives a generic 'client ready' message from the frontend, then sends it's request as a
CAPS reply.  It then waits for another message from the frontend (the DFUI reply) and
replies to that with a generic 'service ready' message.</p>
