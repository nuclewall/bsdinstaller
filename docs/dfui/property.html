<p>A <code>dfui_property</code> gives some information about an object
which may or may not be present.</p>

<p>Properties may either be <i>weak</i>, meaning that frontends can ignore
them and still be considered correct, or they may be <i>strong</i>, meaning
that they carry with them a guarantee of behaviour, and any frontend which
does not conform to that behaviour should be considered incorrect.  The vast
majority of properties are weak.  Frontends are still encouraged to implement
as many weak properties as apply to them, however, as they are used to help
create a more pleasant and effective experience for the user.</p>
